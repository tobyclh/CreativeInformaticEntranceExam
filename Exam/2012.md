## Question 1
1. p-match = $P^n_n$ = $n!$  
2. graph is just connecting all $s_i$ to their respective target nodes, maximum p-match  
$s_1 = t_1$  
$s_2 = t_2$  
$s_3 = t_3$  
$s_4 = t_5$  
$s_5 = t_4$  
3. We can use Maximum flow algorithm and set up a source and sink node, connected to all the students nodes and teachers nodes respectively. Then we set up a residual graph, which indicate the remaining flow possible for each edge. Complexity is O(MN). 
4.
