2. C = A&B, S = A XOR B -->  4 AND gate


## Problem 3
1. Wavelet transform
    Wavelet transform is developed following fourier transformation (FT). FT represents signal with sin wave,which is periodic and have infinite length. This property makes FT less suitable of handling small local changes in signals. Instead, Wavelet transform represents wavelet with signals with zero means and finite length.
2. Cepstrum  
    of a signal $x$ is defined as   
    $c[n] = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{log|\mathcal{F}\{x[n]\}| \}$  
    where $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{F}^{-1}$ are Fourior Transform and Inverse Fourior Transform of the signal.
    Smallest cepstral coefficients correspond to the the spectral properties of the vocal tract.  
3. Deep Learning   
    refers to the trend of using modals with more and more layers, essentially "deeper". Deep learning shows promising results on many areas such as image recognition (VGG16, Inception etc.), detection (Fast RCN), speech recognition (WaveNet) and more tasks. While most of the techniques used in modern deep learning are developed in decades ago, only recently do we have enough calculation power to do the calculation in a large enough scale for it to learn. Key techniques to DL includes SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), GSD (Graduate Students Descent), CNN(Convolution Neural Network), LSTM (long short term memory) and more.  
4. ZMP  
    In many control applications, zero momentum point concerns the stability of system. In order for a dynamic system to be stable at a particular point $x$, it is necessary to not only have velocity $v=0$, but also momentum (or inertia) to be zero. Otherwise it might gain velocity and breaks the stability.
5. SSL  
    stands for secure sockets layer. An SSL certificate have a public and private key pair. When an internet user browse a website, it performs a SSL handshake with the server, before the communication starts involves the following steps.  
    1. Client provides a list of available cipher suites to the server  
    2. The server decides the cipher algorithms and return the decision to the client, along with its digital certificate (including a public key), signed by Certificate Authority.
    3. The client confirms the certificate, generates a random number using the server's public key and send it to the server. Then both parties will use the random number (only decryptable by the server using the server's private key) to generate a session key.
    4. Both parties communicate with each other using the session key.
    5. Alternatively, they could use Diffie-Hellman Key exchange
